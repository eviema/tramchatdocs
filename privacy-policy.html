    <h2>Privacy Policy for TramChat</h2>

    <p>Last updated 14 June 2023</p>

    <h3 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>Welcome to TramChat. We are committed to protecting your privacy and trust, in compliance with the Australian Privacy Act 1988. This privacy policy outlines the information we collect, use, and protect when you use our app. </p>

    <h3 id="collection">2. Limited Collection of Personal Information</h3>
    <p>In general, we do not collect personal information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email, or location. The only exception is when you provide feedback through our app and voluntarily leave your name and contact details. This data, entered into the feedback form's text area, will only be used to contact you, provided you explicitly give your consent for us to do so. This data is stored in a database hosted by Azure Cosmos DB and is deleted after being actioned upon.</p>

    <h3 id="use-of-images">3. Use of Images</h3>
    <p>The TramChat app requires the use of images, either taken directly from your camera or selected from your gallery, to identify the tram stop you're interested in. These images are immediately passed to Microsoft's Azure Computer Vision, a third-party image recognition service, for processing. Microsoft automatically deletes these images after processing and does not use your data to enhance its underlying models. We do not store these images or use them for any other purpose.</p>

    <h3 id="user-data">4. User Data and Performance</h3>
    <p>We collect anonymous user data to improve the performance of TramChat. Information retained, such as the model of your mobile phone and its current operating system, is kept for up to 60 days. This data does not identify a specific end user.</p>

    <h3 id="sharing">5. Sharing and Disclosure of Data</h3>
    <p>We may share the data we collect with third-party service providers, specifically Azure and Bugsnag, to provide and improve our services. In the event of a business transfer, we may share necessary data that would allow a new owner to continue operations, as per legal requirements or advice. We do not use cookies.</p>

    <h3 id="reviews">6. Reviews</h3>
    <p>Any reviews, including usernames and account details, posted on Google Play, Apple App Store, or similar application stores are hosted on the servers of that specific application store.</p>

    <h3 id="childrens-privacy">7. Children's Privacy</h3>
    <p>TramChat is safe for children under 13 years of age. We never knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The ads we show on the app are provided by Google Ads and configured to handle requests in a manner suitable for users under the age of consent. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe we have any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at squareseascent@gmail.com.</p>
  
    <h3 id="security">8. Data Security</h3>
    <p>At TramChat, we are committed to ensuring the security of your data. We collect the minimum amount of data necessary for error notifications, user feedback, and to enhance the performance of our app. This collected information is securely stored and is only accessible by a small, authorised team of developers responsible for handling errors and user feedback. Please note that while we strive to protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.</p>
  
    <h3 id="contact">9. Contact Information</h3>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please contact us at squareseascent@gmail.com.</p>
    
    <h3 id="access">10. Access, Correction and Complaints</h3>
    <p>If you would like to access or correct the personal information we hold about you, or lodge a complaint about our handling of your personal information, you can contact us using the details provided in section 9.</p>

    <h3 id="changes">11. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect any changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page. We encourage you to revisit this page regularly to stay informed about our privacy practices.</p>
